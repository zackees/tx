Easiest way to send files:

*Install*
```bash
pip install wormhole-tx
```

*Run*
```bash
tx myfile.mp4
# Then follow the directions
```

This will generate a `magic-wormhole` command that you can use on the receiving end.

# Background

`magic-wormhole` is even more powerful when properly tuned. `wormhole-tx` gives saner defaults and is more secure with a larger key. The command to run on the receiving end will auto-accept the file and wait for it to begin.

Additionally, the receiving command is generated at the *beginning* instead of the end of the archive building phase. This makes the command quicker to run since you can immediately connect the client to the sender.
